<h2><i>Social Implications of the Technology</i></h2>
<p>
    AI in cybersecurity has several important social implications. On the positive side, it helps protect sensitive data and online systems, 
    which are essential for modern businesses, governments, and individuals. It reduces the risks of data breaches, financial fraud, and 
    identity theft, making the digital world safer and more trustworthy. However, there are concerns too. For example, using AI requires 
    collecting and analyzing a large amount of personal and organizational data, which could lead to privacy violations if not handled 
    responsibly. Another issue is that cybercriminals can use the same technology for malicious purposes, such as creating advanced malware 
    or bypassing security systems. Relying only on AI might reduce the demand for human cybersecurity professionals, potentially causing 
    job displacement in this field. There’s also a risk of over-reliance on AI, which could be problematic if systems fail or are 
    manipulated by attackers.
</p>

<h2><i>Political and Social Concerns</i></h2>
<p>
    Politically, AI-driven cybersecurity systems can be used by governments for surveillance and monitoring. While this may help prevent 
    crimes and terrorism, it can also lead to misuse, such as infringing on citizens' privacy or targeting specific groups unfairly. 
    For example, in authoritarian regimes, these tools might be used to suppress dissent or track activists. Socially, there’s a concern 
    about the fairness of AI systems. If these systems are not carefully designed and monitored, they might reflect biases from the data 
    they are trained on. This could result in unfair treatment, such as flagging certain individuals or groups more often as threats based 
    on their demographic or behavior.
</p>

<h2><i>Innate Harms and Risks</i></h2>
<p>
    <h3>Bias in Decision-Making:</h3> 
	<li>AI models might make biased decisions if trained on flawed or unbalanced data.</li>
    <h3>False Positives and Negatives:</h3>
    <li>Incorrect identification of threats can lead to unnecessary disruptions or allow real threats to go undetected.</li>
    <h3>Data Security Risks:</h3>
    <li>The data used to train AI could be a target for cyberattacks.</li>
    <h3>Dependency:</h3
    <li>Relying only on AI can make systems vulnerable if the AI fails or is compromised.</li>
</p>

<h2><i>Utilitarian Perspective</i></h2>
<p>
    AI in cybersecurity is very useful because it focuses on keeping the majority of people safe and reducing harm. It helps protect 
    sensitive information, stop cyberattacks, and keep systems running smoothly, which matches the goal of providing the greatest benefit 
    to the most people. However, this view can also support actions like collecting a lot of personal data or using surveillance if they 
    are considered necessary for security. The main challenge is finding a balance between these practices and respecting individual rights, 
    as focusing too much on safety might risk violating people’s privacy.
</p>

<h2><i>Deontological Perspective</i></h2>
<p>
    This approach focuses on following ethical rules and responsibilities, no matter the results. From this viewpoint, using AI in 
    cybersecurity must respect essential principles like protecting privacy and being fair. Even though AI can improve security and stop 
    threats, it should not violate basic rights like freedom or data privacy. This perspective stresses the need to create and use AI 
    systems that follow ethical guidelines, making sure security does not come at the cost of these important values.
</p>

<h2><i>Social Contract Perspective</i></h2>
<p>
    The social contract perspective sees AI in cybersecurity as a tool that should be used fairly and transparently. It suggests that 
    governments, businesses, and individuals should work together to create ethical rules for using AI responsibly. This approach highlights 
    the need for trust, which can be built by making clear policies that balance security with values like privacy and equality. By encouraging 
    cooperation and accountability, this perspective aims to ensure that AI benefits everyone while respecting societal values.
